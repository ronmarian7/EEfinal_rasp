## Summary 

This README provides an overview of our final EE project at TAU. Our application efficiently identifies different dog breeds and classifies their poses using machine learning models. The technologies we utilized include Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV for image processing, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface.

## Installation

To set up the EE Final Project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ronmarian7/EEfinal_rasp.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd EEfinal_rasp
    ```

3. Ensure Python 3 is installed. If not, download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

5. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 

Follow the steps below to use the application:

1. **Activate your Server**: Run the `server.py` script on your Raspberry Pi 4. An IP address will be generated and displayed.
2. **Connect to the Server**: Run the `GUI.py` script on your laptop and enter the IP address from the previous step.
3. **Verify Connection**: Confirm that a successful connection is established between the server and the client. A confirmation notification should appear on the client application interface.

If any issues arise, refer to our troubleshooting section or contact us for assistance.
